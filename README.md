# Fantasy Feuds

##Quick Description
- This is a multiplayer capture the flag type game in the which the user purchases characters and then uses them to capture castles.  The more castle each team owns, the faster the other team's healthbar will diminish.  The first team to destroy the other team's healthbar wins.
- This game (main branch) is live here http://fantasyfeuds.com and the 'working' branch periodically live here: http://fantasyfeudsworking.herokuapp.com/
- There are two servers, both are hosted on Heroku.  One server handles the games mechanics and the other server handles both the AI and pathfinding for all characters.
